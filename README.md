# PFControl v2

PFControl is an open-source, real-time flight strip platform for air traffic controllers and pilots. It focuses on fast, collaborative session management with enterprise-level reliability. This repository contains both the frontend and backend for PFControl v2.

We welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature requests. See the Contributing section below to get started.

## Quick start (for users)

If you just want to try or demo PFControl:

- Visit [pfcontrol.com](https://pfcontrol.com)
- Try PFControl by creating a session from the homepage.

## Development — Local setup

Getting started with PFControl development is straightforward. We've set up Docker Compose to handle PostgreSQL and Redis for you, so you don't need to manually configure databases.

### Setup instructions

1. **Install Docker Desktop** (if you don't have it)
   Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and open it. Make sure it fully starts up.

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cephie-studios/pfcontrol-2.git
   cd pfcontrol-2
   ```

3. **Start PostgreSQL and Redis**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```
   This starts local PostgreSQL and Redis containers in the background. First-time setup downloads the images and takes about 30 seconds.

4. **Set up your environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.development
   ```
   This creates a `.env.development` file with localhost connection strings that point to the Docker containers.

5. **Install dependencies and start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

That's it! The frontend will be at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and the backend API at [http://localhost:9901](http://localhost:9901).

**When you're done**, stop the databases with:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

To reset your local database (fresh start), run:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Troubleshooting

- **"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running. Open the Docker Desktop application before running docker-compose commands
- **"Cannot connect to PostgreSQL"**: Make sure Docker Compose is running (`docker ps` should show postgres and redis containers)
- **"Port 5432 already in use"**: You might have PostgreSQL installed locally. Either stop your local PostgreSQL or change the port mapping in `docker-compose.dev.yml`
